# Doctor Onboarding Instructions

## Streamlined Doctor Registration Process

The AksabCare platform now uses a streamlined onboarding process for doctors. Instead of manual profile setup, doctor accounts are automatically linked to pre-configured professional profiles.

### How to Register as a Doctor

1. **Use a Seeded Doctor Email**: Register using one of the pre-configured doctor email addresses from our database
2. **Automatic Profile Linking**: Upon first login, your account will be automatically linked to your professional profile
3. **Instant Access**: No manual setup required - access your dashboard immediately
